<h3>How and why I did it in this way?</h3>
<p>
This is a frontend design work, and the theme has been defined. Even it could very likely be a part of dynamic web page,
I don't think it needs to be implemented with div tag + CSS, because HTML table tags + CSS would simply work, easily to tweak table 
appearance, and is responsive. Since the data in this table are pseudo-data, Javascript is not needed.
</p>
<p>
Do I need to consider using a CSS framework, like BootStrap, Bulma, tailwindCSS? May be not, as it would be much simpler to use CSS and HTML
directly for this table. Using CSS framework could significantly improve the efficiency and speed of front end development, but this
is a decision for the whole website presentation level, not for this level task.
</p>
<p>
Internal CSS and HTML is used to create this html page. If needed, we can easily put CSS code into a seperate CSS file(external CSS).
Since no information available to infer how the project behind this page is organizing/structuring CSS code, I don't think we need to
use any CSS pre-processors like Sass, Less as well.
</p>
<p>
I created this page using VS Code. Chrome is used as a test and debug tool. It was also tested on two other browsers: 
Microsoft Edge, Safari on my phone.
</p>
<h3>What do you consider to be HTML best practices applied to online learning?</h3>
<p>
This is a big question. HTML, CSS and Javascript are 3 core concepts in web development, to create an wonderful e-learning user experience, 
these technologies need to be organized very well, e.g in some well-known web frameworks like PHP laravel, Vue.js, React, Angular etc.
</p>
<p>
I think it would be hard to say what HTML best practices specifically apply to e-learning, but there are many HTML/CSS best practices
can be applied when implement the frontend of an e-learning website, such as, 
  <ul>
    <li>Use meta tag(description, keywords, viewport, Robots), title tag to help SEO for course presentation page </li>
    <li>Do not mix CSS with HTML, unless we have very strong reason to use inline style</li>
    <li>Seperate Javascript from HTML </li>
    <li>Structure CSS and minimize the number of external CSS files</li>
    <li>Minify websiteâ€™s CSS, HTML & Javascript to increase speed of loading page</li>
    <li>Use HTML 5 to create responsive page </li>
    <li> ... </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
Hope I answered your questions.<br><br>
Thanks,<br>
